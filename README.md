# 🟣 TwitchUnblock
**TwitchUnblock** is an open-source iOS application designed to let you watch Twitch VODs (Video on Demand) and Live streams without needing a paid subscription. Built natively with modern SwiftUI, it offers a smooth, ad-free viewing experience with advanced features tailored for power users.

## ✨ Features

* 🕒 **Watch History:** Keep track of your recently watched VODs and favorite channels in a dedicated tab.
* 🔄 **Cloud Sync:** Automatically save your watch progress and history, allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off.
* 🔗 **Third-Party Players:** Export and open streams directly in external players like **VLC**, **Outplayer**, or **Infuse**.
* 🌐 **Custom Proxy:** Built-in proxy toggles to bypass regional restrictions or network blocks.
* 🌙 **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed interface built entirely with SwiftUI for iOS 16+.
